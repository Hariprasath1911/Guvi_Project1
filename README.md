**Retail Data Analysis with Streamlit**
    This project involves the analysis of a retail dataset that has been cleaned, transformed, and stored in an SQL database(using AWS RDS). The data has been deployed in a Streamlit app to provide interactive 
  visualization and insights.

**Project Overview**
This project walks through the following stages:
  **Data Cleaning:** Raw retail data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values, outliers, and irrelevant information.
  **Data Storage:**After the cleaning process, the data was stored in a AWS database and connected to PostgreSQL for easy querying and future use.
  **Streamlit Application:** A Streamlit app was developed to visualize the cleaned data and provide insights into retail performance, including sales trends, product performance, customer demographics, and more.
